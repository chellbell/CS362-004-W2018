• Smithy card draws incorrect number of cards.– Is it reproducible: yes, every time– Description: test #1 asserts that the number of cards in player’s hand changes by the correct amount after playing a smithy card. smithy should draw 3 cards before discarding 1, so hand count should change by 2. this test is failing.– Steps to Reproduce: run cardtest1 (included in Makefile)– Expected Results: test passes– Actual Results: test fails– Workarounds: n/a– Attachments: cardtest1.c, dominion.c, & Makefile in class repo (millerc8-assignment-5 branch) 

• Village card adds incorrect number of net actions– Is it reproducible: yes, every time– Description: test #3 asserts that the player’s net actions changes by the correct amount after playinga village card. net actions should increase by 1. this test is failing.– Steps to Reproduce: run cardtest2 (included in Makefile)– Expected Results: test passes– Actual Results: test fails– Workarounds: n/a– Attachments: cardtest2.c, dominion.c, & Makefile in class repo (millerc8-assignment-5 branch)• discard function does not increase the player’s discard count– Is it reproducible: yes, every time– Description: multiple card tests surfaced this issue - #2 in cardtest1.c (smithy), #2 in cardtest2.c (village), & #2 in cardtest4.c (greathall). these tests all check for a correct check to the discard count after playing various cards. village & smithy both fail multiple tests, but greathall only fails the discard test, leading me to suspect a problem with the discard function.– Steps to Reproduce: run tests listed above (included in Makefile)– Expected Results: tests pass– Actual Results: tests fail– Workarounds: n/a– Attachments: cardtest1.c, cardtest2.c, cardtest4.c, dominion.c, & Makefile in class repo (millerc8- assignment-5 branch)
